### Does the Nomad-Openbao integration affect client counts? {#nomad}

**Maybe**.

[Nomad Openbao integration](/nomad/docs/integrations/vault-integration#token-role-based-integration)
uses token roles where a single token role creates tokens for many Nomad jobs.
Unless you have configured explicit identity aliases for your Nomad tokens,
Openbao will record every running instance of a Nomad job as a unique client.

### Are batch tokens counted differently than service tokens? {#batch-tokens}

**No**.

Batch token clients are counted like service token clients. The batch token is
mapped to either to the associated active entity or an artificial entity that
Openbao creates by combining the assigned namespace and policy. See the
[clients and entities](/docs/concepts/client-count) overview for more
details.

### Do custom user filters affect client counts? {#custom-filters}

**Yes**.

Custom [user filters](/api-docs/auth/ldap#userfilter) can change the way
that entity aliases are mapped, which can affect the client count computation.

Consult the [clients and entities](/docs/concepts/client-count) overview
for more information about how Openbao determines entity assignments.

### Does mount migration affect client counts? {#mount-migration}

**Maybe**.

- Migrating mounts **across** namespace will create duplication in the client count.
- Migrating mounts **within** a namespace will not affect client count.
