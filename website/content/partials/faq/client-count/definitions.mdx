### What is a client? ((#what-is-a-client))

Any unique application, service, or user that authenticates to an
OpenBao cluster. The client count metric is a combination of entity clients and 
non-entity clients.

Consult the [clients and entities](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) overview
for more information on client definitions.

### What is the difference between an entity client, non-entity client, and certificate client? ((#eclient-vs-neclient))

- **Entity clients** map to an active identity.
- **Non-entity clients** map to an active non-entity token.
- **Certificate clients** map to an active ACME PKI certificate.

Consult the [clients and entities](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) overview
for more information about how OpenBao determines entity assignments.
